# scope creep

  I have a huge problem.  

    I start a project (or join one I like), and it's going well. I get into it. That finish line approaches-- it's not just an idea anymore, but a REAL THING!  
    Then I get an idea. And another. And the more interested, the more excited, the more _invested_ I get into the project, the more ideas I have. I can't stop them, and why would I want to? So often I'm sitting here slamming my face on the desk, bleeding all over the place because I just can't get my stupid brain working, so like a two stroke your friend is lending you so you can get to your third job in as many months, when that shit turns over, you HAVE to keep it running. Right?  
    So picture this: I was working on a pamphlet. Simple., It's already been mostly written, in fact, I joined after volunteering to playtest it, and then providing summary feedback and ideas for improvements. It just needs a couple of pieces of art, and some layout. Easy. _Easy!_ THIS is my chance to break into this industry! Get something in under my belt! It's _just what I need!_

    One _full year later_, and the shit is not published. It's been written, refined, tested. I have a map, a wraparound cover, a mood board, paragraphs and paragraphs of discussion on the aesthetics.. TWO blender renders, half finished splash art, several character sketches, monster concept art, some sound design and music in the works, more paragraphs of discussion about monsters, and lore, and connected adventures on a planet where the stuff is being used as a bioweapon and how and why they would and  

### ***WOAH!!!***

    What the fuck, right?  And _still_ no published material. No updates. No backerkit. No itch. Nothing. _Nada._  

    So here it is: a commitment to change. As much as I hate that stupid fucking phrase, I can't keep doing the same thing and expecting different results. I'm so tired of feeling paralyzed. Affinity is free now- no more excuses. By 2026, this trifold will be on my itch, and if people like it, its not like all the cool art and ideas go in the memory hole: I could always do like the incredible [Graveyard of the Gods](https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/hammer-city-games/graveyard-of-the-gods-unearthed-for-mothership){:target="_blank"} (truly, one of my favorite Mosh modules on either side of the screen) and rerelease it with more/better content. Or just update the pdf. Or fuck, write a sequel! 

    The problem is **not** that I have too many ideas. The problem is that I am **hoarding** ideas, and knowledge, and information, endlessly consuming and procrastinating instead of forming all these precipitative thoughts into _something_. I know what to do. The _point_ is to let the flow of ideas facilitate cool shit, instead of enabling further excuses to do nothing.
