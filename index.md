i shoot and develop 35mm and digital, looking into 16mm video. i also draw, paint, write, and generally make things in whatever medium or form i'm currently interested in. my special interest is collecting interests.

i was tasked with making a blog and a mailing list by people i respect who are much further along than i am.

eventually, if i keep this up, i will likely migrate to my own website, but i wanted to get ahead of myself and just put something out there so that i do it at all. i'm very, very easily distracted.
